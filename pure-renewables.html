		<h3>Branding</h3>
		<p>The "green" market place is overrun with clich√©s: blue skies and cornfields abound! We commissioned Matt Thomas to produce a series of custom info-graphics with a simple brief: Explain the technology; keep it simple and friendly and show the difference it will make to everyday life.</p>

		<h3>Website Redesign</h3>
		<p>The visual design follows the brand direction of "simple and friendly", using warm colors, zumzing built a visual language that is professional without being too corporate or techy.</p>
		<p>As well as visual design, the presentation of each technology hangs ideas on three themes: Save. Learn. Earn. Each theme targets known felt needs for Pure Renewables client base, environmental stewardship, lowering energy bills, and taking advantage of state incentives to adopt renewable energy solutions.</p>

		<h3>Home App Architecture</h3>
		<p>Today's apps have to do a lot behind the scenes: managing security, media and animation in a way that keeps the user interface responsive, and the code clean. ZUMZING designed the foundation framework for Journey's team of interaction designers to build on.</p>

		<h3>Game Engine Programming</h3>
		<p>ZUMZING developed three custom flash games for the USPS Go Green product series, a 15 square game, a memory game and "bottle drop", a target based game. All games were aimed at 5-12 year-olds with multiple levels of difficulty to accommodate the age range.</p>
